    "> Turn a notebook into a `pip`-installable package, tracked in git, with Continuous Integration that evaluates code quality automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The questions\n",
    "\n",
    "* How does `import` work?\n",
    "* How do I make some Python code `pip` installable?\n",
    "* What is Continuous Integration and why is it useful?\n",

    "## The script\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Turn a notebook into `.py` scripts\n",
    "2. Create a package (a directory with a `__init__.py`)\n",
    "3. Lay out the directory structure according to [the only correct guide available out there](https://blog.ionelmc.ro/2014/05/25/python-packaging/) ([Why?](https://blog.ionelmc.ro/2014/06/25/python-packaging-pitfalls/) [But, really, why?](https://hynek.me/articles/testing-packaging/))\n",
    "4. Write a `setup.py` and a `README`\n",
    "5. Test the local installation ðŸŽ‰\n",
    "6. Write an entry point (a `__main__.py`) that executes the main function\n",
    "7. Push to GitHub!\n",
    "8. Configure a Continuous Integration service (using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/))\n",
    "9. Set up a CI step that checks the quality of our code using `pycodestyle`\n",
    "10. Create our first pull request to ourselves, fix issues, and merge ðŸ™Œ"

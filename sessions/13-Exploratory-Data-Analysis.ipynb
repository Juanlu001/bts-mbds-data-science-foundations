    "2. Count the categorical variables: how many unique stores, items, product families... are there?\n",
    "3. Try to find out what families of products have integer `unit_sales` and which ones have a floating point value, and plot the overall distribution of both\n",
    "4. Are there any days without transactions/sales? Is this data consistent with the vacations?\n",
    "5. Visualize the transactions volume by year and month in one single plot. Do you observe anything special?\n",
    "6. Visualize the transactions volume by day of week. Is there a weekday/weekend pattern in the data?\n",
